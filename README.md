# Chat Project
This repo is my work-in-progress portfolio project and an early version of an European AI start-up named Artificial Intelligence for Urbanity (AI4U). The main focus of AI4U is to apply post-training on open-source models and customize their potential while also intrconnecting their modalities to offer solid b2b services and general use models.

# Mission
We stand for safety, transparency, openess and sharing when it comes to AI development. We work with the universal European values and qualities and aim to make the old continent competitive in the world race for Intelligence but without looking for shortcuts or moral compromises. 

# Disclaimer 
AI4U is under development and retains the copyrights of its own mission and branding, therefore the code in this repo should not be used in its entirety but only partially and ideally for educational purposes. The content of this repo will remain available until the formal establishment of the start-up, then a sharing strategy will be drafted to be effective and in line with the company's mission.
