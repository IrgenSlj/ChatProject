# Chat Project
This repo is my work-in-progress portfolio project and an early version of an European AI start-up named Artificial Intelligence for Urbanity (AI4U). The main focus of AI4U is to apply post-training on open-source models and customize their potential while also intrconnecting their modalities to offer solid b2b services and general use models.
